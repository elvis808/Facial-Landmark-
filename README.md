# Facial Landmark Detection

This application utilizes Javascript to detect and map keypoints around my face to create a facial landmark. Also incorporated Tensorflow.js, ML for JavaScript, with react webcam for this project. Crazy to believe that this face landmark detection can pin point and predict up to 486 key points for your face to identify facial movements and features. Tensorflow.js was fun, more projects coming soon..
