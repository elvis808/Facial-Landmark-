# Facial Landmark Detection

This application uses Javascript to detect and map keypoints around my face to create a facial landmark. Incorporated Tensorflow.js, a ML for JavaScript language, with react webcam for this project. Crazy to believe that this face landmark detection can pin point and predict up to 486 key points for your face to identify facial movements and features.

{*Please wait a few seconds for the face-cam to detect your face. I advise to stay in a well-lit area so that the camera can pinpoint the key points on your face.*}
